ðŸ¤– Automate ["It is as if you were doing work"](https://pippinbarr.github.io/itisasifyouweredoingwork/)

## Building the snippet

```

npm install

# Build the script
npm run build

# You can find the snippet in the dist directory
```

## Using the snippet

Open the console and paste the generated snippet.

Run `window.autowork.addListeners` to start automating work.

Run `window.autowork.removeListeners` to stop automating work.

Run `window.autowork.killDialogs` to clear the screen.

## Why Webpack?

I want to be able to include libraries if necessary. Webpack is a straightforward way to do this. 

Note: We are assuming we are running in the "It is as if you were doing work" environment. This means we assume jQuery and jQuery UI are present.

I also want to minimize the build size. For this reason, I'm using $.datepicker to parse dates, rather than something like moment.
